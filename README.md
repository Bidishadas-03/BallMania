# BallMania
A Java Project

About the Project :

This is a fun and interactive Brick Breaker game developed using Java and Swing in the Eclipse IDE. The game involves a paddle controlled by the player, a bouncing ball, and a grid of bricks. The objective is simple: break all the bricks without letting the ball fall.

Key Features :

* Real-time gameplay with smooth ball movement and collision detection
* Score tracking and win/lose screens
* Keyboard controls to move the paddle and restart the game
* Dynamic map generation with customizable rows and columns of bricks
* Clean and organized GUI using JFrame and JPanel

Game Mechanics :

* The paddle moves left/right using arrow keys.
* When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases.
* If the player breaks all bricks, they win. If the ball hits the bottom edge, it's game over.
* Pressing Enter restarts the game.

Technologies Used

* Java SE
* Swing (for GUI)
* OOP concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation
* Event handling using KeyListener and ActionListener
